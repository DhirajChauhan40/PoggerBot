# Guidelines for POGGERBOT
We value all of your input and criticism that would help this bot become better and more fun to use. To recommend a course of action, please type in an issue [here](https://github.com/cdhiraj40/PoggerBot/issues). You can contribute for an existing issue, for any bug that you may notice, for a new feature that sounds fun, etc.

## Languages
If you want to work on another language alongside python, we will glady accept it into the bot as long as it works well with it. Of course, if you are coding in python, it would be best if you try to follow the [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to keep the code as neat as possible.
